# ipoema-tumblr [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aleDsz/ipoema-tumblr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aleDsz/ipoema-tumblr)

A theme created to specific user of tumblr: [iPoema](http://ipoema.tumblr.com/). This tumblr was created to posts poems from Alexandre de Souza.

So, I decided to create my own theme just for fun and to learn how Tumblr works. In a  time, I'll be sharing my theme with another users.

That's all folks.
